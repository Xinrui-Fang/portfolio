			<h2>Problem Overview</h2>
			<p class="p-margin">
				Western modern architecture trend has taken great impact to the growth of Chinese cities. Nowadays, Chinese architects realize that we have lost our own culture in this procedure. Today, Chinese architects start to find our own culture origin, which roots in Chinese traditional villages deeply.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our team wants to learn about what kind of information and data of traditional villages architects need to collect on the internet, and how do they make a Chinese traditional village research before, including what goals they try to achieve when using these tools. We want to determine what opportunities and needs might exist for our platform, so that we can use these findings to help us shape the direction we take in developing our product.
			</p>

			<h2>Discovery: Research & Analysis</h2>
			<p>We conducted two kinds of user reserach Semi-Structured Interview and Survey to explore user mental models and pain points. I recruited 3 participants in the Semi-Structured Interview and 10 participants in the Survey. We collected and summarized the data as affinity diagram. </p>

			<h3>Key Findings</h3>
			<p class="p-margin">The significant user needs found within this study are:</p>
			<p class="findings">100% of architects think the location is one of the main factor when they plan a research journey to decide where to visit.</p>
			<div class="reserach-block">
				<p class="participants p-margin">“Some villages are far away from the city, and lack of public transportation, the distance block my wish to visit their” – Participant 1</p>

				<p class="participants margin-1">“If the picture attracts me. I will visit there.” –Participant 2</p>
				<p class="participants p-margin">“I will look through Weibo to see some photos of the villages and choose to visit.” – Participant 3</p>
			</div>

			<p class="findings">All the architects would like to select best photos and publish on WeChat Moment after research trip</p>
			<div class="reserach-block">
				<p class="participants margin-1">“I would like to share beautiful pictures with my friends and attract them to come.” –Participant 1</p>
				<p class="participants p-margin">“I want to share amazing architecture to my friends because it is really interesting” -Participant 2</p>
			</div>

			<p class="findings">More than half participants like to observe original people in the village</p>
			<div class="reserach-block">
			<p class="participants margin-1">“People is important in the village, it is meaningless if the village is empty.” –Participant 3</p>
			<p class="participants">“The relationship of people and village is also an important aspect when we research on village” -- Participant2</p>

			<h2>Usability Study and Design Iteration</h2>
			<h3>Usability Study</h3>
			<p>We implemented usability study when we made our first iteration clickable prototype. A usability session is scheduled and two students from Student Hub are invited in this study. We observed how users interacted with the clickable prototype and created a concise journey map with each stage broken into small tasks.</p>

		<section class="usability test" style="margin-top: 3rem;">
			<h2>Usability Test</h2>
			<p>After finishing first mockup, I recruit 10 users to test on this clickable prototype with web usability test platform 'Lookup' to get feedback for further iteration. From analysis, I found some opportunities for me to iterate my design:</p>
			<div class="lookup">
				<div class="lookup-img"><img class="sketchImg laptop" src="imgs/lookup.png" alt=""></div>
				<div>
					<ul>
					<li>When users enter the home page, they will customly to click the map, though the map is not clickable. It seems that my design is not intuitive and needs to iterate further</li>
					<li>There is a triangle at the home page which is clickable to zoom the map to the whole page. However, nobody click this button, so it’s discoveriably is really poor, I add a succinct introduction below it in my iteration.</li>
					<li>The contract of color in the login page doesn’t conform to WCAG AAA criteria. I modify the color in the iteration.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section class="iteration" style="margin-top: 3rem;">
			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p class="p-margin">Iterate the mockup according to the feedback from usability test.</p>

		<section class="wrap up">
			<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
			<p class="p-margin">For my design process, firstly, I defined my product and designed a user research report and recruited 3 architects to ask them questions about the on the report. After collecting the information, I listed their opinions to affinity diagrams to find opportunities in them. And then, I used idea generating methods like Craz-8 to design wireframes of my product and drew it wireframes on Figma. Up next, I drew the clickable prototype of my product and recruited 10 users to do usability test with Lookback. After usability test, I iterate my design and published it.</p>
			<p class="p-margin">In this process, I implemented design skills like user research, prototyping iterating and usability test. An interesting insight I encountered is that the map of my first mockup is not clickable. However, I found that in the usability test, a mount of users tried to click the map. So according to usability test, I iterate my design and changed the map to clickable, which is more intuitive to users.</p>
			<p class="p-margin">I made a tradeoff when I chose the color. Firstly, I chose some color in a suite, however, I found that when I separate them into foreground color and background color, the color contract did not conform to criteria. Then I change the foreground color to improve it readability.</p>
			<p>Due to usability test, I have a confidence that my design can give user relatively good experience on Chinese traditional village research. However, it’s too simple, and needs to add more functions on it.</p>
