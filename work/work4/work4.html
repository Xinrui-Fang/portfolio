			<h2>Concept Design</h2>
			<p>
				24 Hours Competation is a design competation for designers and architects to give a solution for a designated issue in 24 hours. It's so interesting and I participated twice.

			<h3> 31st edition babel | <a href="https://www.if-ideasforward.com/babel">the new Babel Tower</a></h3>
			<p class="p-margin">The Babel Tower is one of the most intriguing tales in human history, supposedly built by men who wanted to make the tower high enough to reach the Gods. However, the Gods got angry and pushed down the tower, separated people into different languages to prevent them communicate with each other.</p>
			<p class="p-margin">The purpose of this competition is to recreate what would be the Babel Tower today. A tower that symbolizes the unity of peoples, regardless of their color, race or religion. A tower that values the human race as one. Above all a tower that breaks the current building model. An environmentally friendly tower.</p>
			<p>Cubic Tower is a dynamic living system for all people with different color, race or religion to live. Cubic Tower is composed of single unit, which is the section of tower crane. We insert simple cubic box into each unit and grant it specific function.</p>

			<h3> 28th edition everest | <a href="https://www.if-ideasforward.com/babel">base camp</a></h3>
			<p class="p-margin">
				The Mountain Everest is the sacred palace for people living around Nepal and Tibet. It is so fascinating and attracts thousands of people come to explore. However, the Everest is extremely dangerous that more than 200 frozen dead bodies are lying along the way to the top. Avalanche, lack of oxygen and severe cold top the list of main factors that cause explorer to die. Even today, the living condition in the camps of the Everest is really poor and takes its tolls on explorers.
			</p>
			<p>
				I designed a new shelter, which can be assembled by dispersed components. Thus it is convenient to transport by yak and human to where vehicles can not arrive. Moreover, this new shelter has a curved top which can eliminate the impair from avalanche.
